                                        We are a mission-minded church that believes in spreading the gospel to the uttermost ends of the earth, because we are the hands and feet of Christ on the earth. We believe that the gifts of the Spirit are at work in the life of the believer, so our services are an experience of the uninhibited flow of the Spirit through prayer, prophecies, and
                                        spiritual songs. We believe that the Word of God is the ultimate standard for doctrine. We believe that the Fatherâ€™s biggest display of affection towards us is in the redemptive work of Christ. We believe that we are blessed because righteousness is credited to us through the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ.
